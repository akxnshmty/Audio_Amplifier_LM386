# 🔊 LM386 Audio Amplifier PCB Design

This is a custom-designed audio amplifier circuit using the **LM386** IC, created in **KiCad**. The amplifier is compact, efficient, and suitable for driving small speakers. Ideal for hobbyist audio projects and beginner embedded electronics enthusiasts.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Based on the **LM386** audio amplifier IC.
- 🔋 Powered via a **DC barrel jack** (standard 12V input).
- 🎛️ Integrated **SPST switch** for power control.
- 📉 Includes **bypass capacitor** (C5) for noise reduction.
- 🔊 Potentiometer (RV1) for **volume control**.
- 📦 Designed with **professional component placement and rounded PCB corners**.
- ⚡️ Ground plane with zone fill for better noise immunity.
